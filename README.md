#### The NetEase Cloud Music scraper for Gsetant platform can search and match based on song name, artist name, and album name. Gsetant can be automatically installed through this project address on the administrator plug-in management page https://github.com/gsetant/NeteaseCloudMusic


#### This scraper needs to be combined with Netease Cloud API for data scrape, and users need to deploy the following API services by themselves https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi

#### If you use the public Gsetant server, you do not need the install the API services.

#### The user needs to manually modify the value of the global variable url in the main.py file to the available NetEase Cloud API address (the default is http://127.0.0.1:3000)
